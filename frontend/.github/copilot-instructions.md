This is a Next.js MVP frontend for BreezyPath. The app should:
- Allow users to input origin and destination (lat/lng or address)
- Call the backend API to get best, alternative, and worst routes
- Display route info, air quality, and steps in a modern, readable UI
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Keep code simple and modular for demo purposes
